    <h1>Factory Objects</h1>

    <pre>

        In Siemens NX and NX Open, "factory objects" refer to objects that are responsible for creating or instantiating
        different types of elements within the software environment. These objects act as factories or builders for various
        components or functionalities available in NX.

        Factory objects in NX Open are typically used to create or generate instances of specific types of objects or entities,
        such as parts, features, bodies, sketches, curves, annotations, and more. They serve as a mechanism to produce these
        entities within the NX environment.

        For instance, if you want to create a new part, a factory object will be responsible for generating an instance of that
        part. Similarly, if you wish to add a feature like a hole or a fillet to a part, the corresponding feature factory
        object will be used to create that feature.

        The use of factory objects simplifies the process of creating or accessing different elements within NX by providing a
        consistent and standardized way to generate these entities. It often involves specific methods or functions within the
        NX Open API that are associated with these factory objects for creating, modifying, or obtaining various components or
        functionalities.

        By leveraging factory objects, users working with the NX Open API can efficiently create and manipulate elements within
        the Siemens NX environment, streamlining the process of generating parts, features, sketches, and other design elements.
        These factory objects play a significant role in facilitating the creation and manipulation of different entities or
        components within the software.

    <h2>Factory object definition</h2>
<br>

    <pre>

        In NX Open, an object is usually not created by calling a constructor function. Instead, you use a “create” function that
        is a member function of some “factory” object. The “factory” concept is well-known in the software engineering field —
        just as in real life, a factory is a place where you produce new items. Different types of objects use different types
        of factories. Typically, you can get a suitable factory object from an NX Open.Part object (usually the work part), or
        from an NXOpen.Session object. So, suppose for example, that we want to create a point in a part named myPart. The
        relevant factory object is a PointCollection object called myPart.Points.

            {
                Session thesession = Session.GetSession();
                Part Workpart = thesession.Parts.Work;
                ListingWindow lw = thesession.ListingWindow;
                Pointcollection myPart = Workpart.Points;
                foreach (Point item in myPart)
                {
                    lw.WriteLine(item.JournalIdentifier);             
                }      
            }
            
            public static int GetUnloadOption(string args)
            {
                return (int)NXOpen.Session.LibraryUnloadOption.Immediately;

        Sometimes the factory object provides functions for directly creating objects, as in the example above. Other times, the
        factory object provides functions for creating “builder” objects, instead, as discussed in the next section. The
        following table shows some common examples of factory objects, how you obtain instances of these factory objects, and
        what sorts of creation functions they provide:
