    <h1>Object Collections</h1>

    <br>

    <pre>
        In Siemens NX and its programming interface NX Open, "Object Collections" represent groups or containers that hold and
        manage multiple objects of a similar type or category. These collections provide a convenient way to gather, organize,
        and access related objects within the NX environment.

        Object Collections serve various purposes, offering functionalities that allow users to:

        1. Group Objects: Objects with similar characteristics or belonging to the same category can be grouped together within
        a collection. For example, a collection could contain all the features of a part, all the sketches within an assembly,
        or all the edges of a specific face.

        2. Organize and Access: Collections provide a means to organize and manage related objects, making it easier to access
        and manipulate them collectively. This simplifies operations on multiple objects simultaneously.

        3. Iterate and Traverse: Object Collections often support iteration, allowing users to traverse through the contained
        objects, retrieve information, and perform operations on each object in the collection in a systematic manner.
        4. Selection and Filtering: They can help in selecting specific subsets of objects based on certain criteria or
        properties. For instance, a collection can be used to filter out all the circular edges or specific types of features
        from a part.

        Examples of Object Collections in NX Open might include collections of faces, edges, sketches, features, components,
        dimensions, or other entities that are commonly accessed and managed together.

        Using Object Collections in NX Open API offers a more efficient and organized way to handle multiple objects, enabling
        users to perform operations on numerous related objects at once, iterate through them, and apply actions based on
        specific criteria, contributing to more streamlined and effective design automation and manipulation processes within
        Siemens NX.
