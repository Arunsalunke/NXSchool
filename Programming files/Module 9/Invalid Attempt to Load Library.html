    <h1>Invalid Attempt to load Library</h1>

    <pre>
        <b>1. Check Library Paths:</b>
        
        Ensure that the path to the DLL or shared library you are trying to load is correct. Verify that the file exists in the
        specified location.

        <b>2. Library Compatibility:</b>
        
        Make sure that the version of the library you are trying to load is compatible with the version of NXOpen and Siemens NX
        that you are using. Incompatibilities can lead to loading errors.

        <b>3. Dependencies:</b>
        
        Check for any dependencies that the library might have. Ensure that all required dependencies are available and
        correctly configured on your system.

        <b>4. Environment Variables:</b>
        
        Verify that any required environment variables, such as PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH, are set correctly to include the
        directories containing the necessary libraries.

        <b>5. Check for Typos:</b>
         
        Double-check your code for any typographical errors in the library names or paths. Even a small mistake can lead to
        loading failures.

        <b>6. Library Loading Sequence:</b>
        
        Pay attention to the sequence in which libraries are being loaded. Sometimes, the order of loading libraries matters,
        especially if there are dependencies between them.

        <b>7. Use Dependency Walker:</b>
        
        Use a tool like Dependency Walker (for Windows) or ldd (for Linux) to check the dependencies of your DLL or shared
        library. This can help identify missing dependencies.
        
        <b>8. Logging:</b>
        
        Enable logging for NXOpen and examine the log files for any additional information or error messages related to the
        library loading issue.

        <b>9. Rebuild the Library:</b>
        
        If you have access to the source code of the library, consider rebuilding it to ensure compatibility with your current
        environment.

        <b>10. Update Siemens NX and NXOpen:</b>
        
        Ensure that you are using the latest version of Siemens NX and NXOpen. Updates may include fixes for known issues
        related to library loading.

        <b>11. Consult Siemens Support:</b>
        
        If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Siemens Support. Provide them with details about the error, including
        the log files, and seek assistance in resolving the problem.
