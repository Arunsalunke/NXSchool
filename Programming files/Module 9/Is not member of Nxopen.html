    <h1>Is not a member of NXopen</h1>

    <pre>
        <b>1. Namespace or Class Name Typo:</b>
        
        Double-check your code to ensure that you are using the correct namespace and class names from the NXOpen library. Typos
        in the names can lead to this error.

        <b>2. Library Reference:</b>
        
        Confirm that your project or script is correctly referencing the NXOpen library. Ensure that the library is added to
        your project references or properly imported in your script.

        <b>3. Correct NXOpen Version:</b>
        
        Make sure that you are using the correct version of NXOpen that corresponds to the version of Siemens NX you are working
        with. Incompatibility between versions can cause this error.

        <b>4. Code Structure:</b>
        
        Verify the structure of your code. Ensure that the code attempting to use the NXOpen component is within the correct
        scope or region and that there are no syntax errors.

        <b>5. Documentation Check:</b>
        
        Refer to the NXOpen documentation for the version you are using. It provides details about the available classes,
        methods, and properties. Ensure that what you are trying to use is indeed part of the library.

        <b>6. Using Statements (C#) or Imports (VB.NET):</b>
        
        In languages like C# or VB.NET, use the appropriate using or Imports statements to bring in the necessary namespaces.
        For example, in C#, you might have using NXOpen;.

        <b>7. Intellisense or Code Completion:</b>
        
        Leverage your IDE's features for code completion or Intellisense. This can help you discover and select the correct
        components from the NXOpen library.

        <b>8. Library Versions:</b>
        
        Verify that the version of NXOpen referenced in your project matches the version of Siemens NX you are using. Mismatched
        versions can result in unrecognized components.

        <b>9. Check for Obsolete Components:</b>
        
        Occasionally, components in a library might become obsolete in newer versions. Ensure that the components you are using
        are not deprecated or replaced by newer alternatives.

        <b>10. Consult Siemens Support:</b>
        
        If the issue persists and you cannot identify the cause, consider reaching out to Siemens support. They may be able to
        provide specific guidance based on the details of your code and the environment.
