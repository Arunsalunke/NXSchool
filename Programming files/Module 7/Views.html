    <h1>Views and it's properties</h1>
    <br>

    <pre>
                In NX (Unigraphics NX), view properties refer to the settings and characteristics associated with the different views
                you create on a drawing sheet. These properties allow you to control the appearance and behavior of the views, ensuring
                that they convey the necessary information accurately. Here are some key aspects of view properties in UG NX:
                
                <b>View Scale: </b>
                The scale of a view determines the size at which the 3D model is represented on the drawing sheet. You can set the scale
                based on factors such as the level of detail required and the available space on the sheet.
                
                <b>View Display:</b>
                UG NX provides options for displaying or hiding certain elements within a view. This includes features like hidden
                lines, tangent edges, and other visibility settings that help communicate the design intent effectively.
                
                <b>View Type:</b>
                Different types of views, such as orthographic, isometric, and detailed views, can be created in UG NX. Each view type
                has specific properties and settings that you can customize based on your drawing requirements.
                
                <b>Section Views:</b>
                If you create section views to show internal details of a part, you can adjust properties such as the cutting plane,
                section depth, and hatching style. This helps in clearly presenting the sectional information.
                
                <b>Detail Views:</b>
                Detail views focus on specific areas of the drawing at an enlarged scale. You can customize properties such as the
                detail view scale factor and the appearance of the detail boundary.
                
                <b>Projected Views:</b>
                Projected views are additional views created from existing views. You can control properties like the projection
                direction and the alignment of projected views.
                
                <b>View Labels and Annotations:</b>
                UG NX allows you to add labels and annotations to views, providing information such as view names, scale, and other
                relevant details. These annotations can be customized based on your drafting standards.
                
                <b>View Alignment and Arrangement:</b>
                You can control the alignment and arrangement of views on the drawing sheet. UG NX provides tools to organize views in a
                logical and readable manner.
                
                <b>Associativity:</b>
                Views in UG NX are typically associative to the 3D model. This means that if the 3D model is updated, the associated
                views on the drawing sheet can be automatically updated to reflect the changes.
                Accessing and modifying view properties in UG NX is typically done through the drafting environment. You can select a
                view, right-click, and access the properties dialog or use specific drafting commands to customize view settings.
