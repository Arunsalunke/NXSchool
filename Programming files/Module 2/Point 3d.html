    <h1>Point 3d Object</h1>

    <br>

    <pre>
        In the context of Siemens NX (formerly Unigraphics or UG), Point3D objects are used to represent points in a
        three-dimensional space within the NX Open API.

        The Point3D class represents a point in 3D space and is part of the NX Open namespace. It contains X, Y, and Z
        coordinates to define a point's position.

    <h2>Example</h2>

    <div class="Block">
        <pre>
            using NXOpen;
            
            namespace Point_3d
            {
                public class Point_3d
                 {
                    public static void Main(string[] args)
                    {
                        Session theSession = Session.GetSession();
                        Part workPart = theSession.Parts.Work;
                        ListingWindow lw = theSession.ListingWindow;
                        
                        Point3d p1 = new Point3d(10, 20, 30);
                        
                       <h5 style="color: green; font-size: medium;">// other way</h5> 

                        Point3d p2 = new Point3d();
                        p2.X = 100;
                        p2.Y = 104;
                        p2.Z = 120;
                   
                    }
                    
                    public static int GetUnloadOption(string args)
                    {
                        return (int)NXOpen.Session.LibraryUnloadOption.Immediately;
                  
                    }
           
                 }
            }
        </pre>
    </div>

        The above code shows the creation of a Point3D object with coordinates (10.0, 20.0, 30.0). It demonstrates how to access
        and manipulate the coordinates of the point.

        In NX Open, these Point3D objects are commonly used when dealing with geometric entities such as curves, surfaces, or
        bodies to specify positions, directions, or locations for various operations or transformations within the software.

       <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Note that a Point3d is not a real NX object. </span> Point3d objects only exist in your NX Open program â€” they are not stored
        permanently in your NX model (or anywhere else). So, as soon as your program has finished running, all your Point3d
        objects are gone. In this sense, they are just like the numerical variables that you use in your programs. If you want
        to create a permanent NX object to record a location.
