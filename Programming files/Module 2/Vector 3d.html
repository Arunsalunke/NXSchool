    <h1>Vector 3d</h1>

    <br>

    <pre>
        In the context of computer graphics, mathematics, and 3D modeling, a Vector3D (or Vector3) represents a mathematical
        entity used to describe a direction and magnitude in a three-dimensional space. It's a fundamental concept in computer
        graphics, physics, and engineering, often used to represent translations, rotations, forces, velocities, and more.
        
        Vectors play a crucial role in 3D graphics, where they can represent translation, orientation, scaling, and other
        transformations of objects. They also find applications in physics simulations for modeling forces, velocities, and
        accelerations.

        Depending on the specific implementation or library, the methods and operations might differ, but the basic idea of a
        Vector3D remains consistent: a representation of a directed line segment in three-dimensional space with an x, y, and z
        component.

        The Vector3d class allows you to create vectors in a three-dimensional space, access their components (X, Y, Z), perform
        operations like obtaining the vector's magnitude, scaling the vector by a scalar value, and other vector-related
        calculations.

        These vectors are often used in NX Open for defining directions, orientations, translations, or other geometric
        operations within the NX software, especially when dealing with design, simulations, and manufacturing processes. The
        methods and operations may vary based on the specific version of NX or programming context but retain the fundamental
        idea of representing a vector in a three-dimensional space.

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">   "Vector3d object represents a direction or a displacement in 3D space. Like Point3d objects, Vector3d objects only
            exist in your NX Open program â€” they are not stored permanently in your NX model (or anywhere else). You can use the
            following constructor function to create Vector3d objects:"</span>
