    <h1>Type Casting</h1>
    <pre>
        Type casting in C# is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. C# supports two main types of
        casting: implicit casting (also known as widening conversion) and explicit casting (also known as narrowing conversion).
        The choice between implicit and explicit casting depends on whether the conversion is considered safe or might result in
        data loss or unexpected behavior.

    <h2>1. Implicit Casting (Widening Conversion):</h2>

    <pre>
        Type casting in C# is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. C# supports two main types of
        casting: implicit casting (also known as widening conversion) and explicit casting (also known as narrowing conversion).
        The choice between implicit and explicit casting depends on whether the conversion is considered safe or might result in
        data loss or unexpected behavior.
        
        Implicit casting is performed automatically by the compiler when there is no risk of data loss. For example, converting an int to a long.
    </pre>

    <div class="Block">

        <pre>
            int intValue = 42;
            long longValue = intValue; // Implicit casting from int to long
        </pre>
    </div>

    <pre>
        In this case, the compiler allows the conversion from int to long without requiring any explicit casting syntax.
    </pre>


    <h2>2. Explicit Casting (Narrowing Conversion):</h2>

    <pre>
        Explicit casting is required when there is a possibility of data loss, and the programmer needs to explicitly indicate
        the conversion. This is done using the cast operator. For example, converting a double to an int:
    </pre>

    <div class="Block">
        <pre>
            double doubleValue = 123.45;
            int intValue = (int)doubleValue; // Explicit casting from double to int
        </pre>
    </div>

    <pre>
        Here, the (int) is used to explicitly cast the doubleValue to an int. Note that this may result in the loss of the
        fractional part of the number.
    </pre>

    <h2>Checking for Type Compatibility:</h2>
    <pre>
        Before performing explicit casting, it's a good practice to check whether the conversion is possible to avoid runtime
        errors. This can be done using the is keyword and the as operator:
    </pre>

    <div style="height: 300; background-color: lemonchiffon; width: 1000px; display: flex; overflow: scroll;">
        <pre>
            object someObject = "Hello";
            if (someObject is string)
            {
            string stringValue = (string)someObject;
            // Do something with stringValue
            }
            else
            {
            // Handle the case where the object is not of the expected type
            }
        </pre>
    </div>

    <pre>
        It's important to note that explicit casting should be used with caution, as it may lead to runtime errors if the types
        are not compatible. Always ensure that the conversion is valid based on the context of your program.
